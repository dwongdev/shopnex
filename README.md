# ShopNex – The Open Source eCommerce Built on Payload CMS

**ShopNex** is a modern eCommerce template powered by **Payload CMS**, designed to help you launch a fully functional online store with ease. Whether you're starting a new store or building a scalable commerce platform, ShopNex provides a robust set of features and tools to streamline your development process.

Here’s a cleaner and more polished version of your **Getting Started** section with better formatting, a clearer explanation of the CLI command, and flag descriptions:

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Spin up a new **ShopNex** project in seconds using our CLI tool:

### 1. Create a New Project

Run one of the following commands:

```bash
pnpm dlx create-shopnex-app
# or
npx create-shopnex-app
```

This command will guide you through the setup process, prompting you for options like your preferred database and environment configuration.

---

### 2. Choose Your Storefront

ShopNex offers two options for your storefront:

#### Builder.io Visual Builder

If you choose Builder.io as your storefront:

1. Configure your `.env` file with Builder.io credentials
2. Run `pnpm run pages:seed` to seed your Builder.io pages

#### To start app in development mode

- Start Payload CMS

```bash
pnpm run dev:cms
```

- Start Shop storefront

```bash
pnpm run dev:shop
```

---

### 3. Optional CLI Flags

You can customize the setup behavior using the following flags:

| Flag         | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--fresh`    | Skips seeding of initial data. Starts a clean setup.                       |
| `--skip-env` | Skips environment variable setup. You can configure `.env` manually later. |
| `--skip-dev` | Does not automatically start the development server after setup.           |

Example usage:

```bash
pnpm dlx create-shopnex-app my-store --fresh --skip-env
```
